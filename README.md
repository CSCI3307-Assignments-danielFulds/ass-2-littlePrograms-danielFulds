2.6 Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.5, write a complete program that calculates
and prints the product of three integers.

2.15 (Arithmetic) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them
from the user and prints their sum, product, difference and quotient (division). Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.7.

2.16 (Comparing Integers) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains
them from the user and displays the larger number followed by the words "is larger". If the numbers
are equal, print the message "These numbers are equal". Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.15.

2.17 (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write an application that inputs three integers from the
user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.15. [Note: The calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not
2.3333….]

2.18 (Displaying Shapes with Asterisks) Write an application that displays a box, an oval, an arrow
and a diamond using asterisks (*)

RQ2.1 7.	Write a program  (call it Program_RQ_2_1), that displays the result of
5.5	x 2.5 – 1.3 x 3
-----------------------
31.5 – 1.5

3.11 (Modified Account Class) Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a method called withdraw
that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed
the Account’s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the method should print
a message indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance." Modify class AccountTest
(Fig. 3.9) to test method withdraw.

4.20 (Salary Calculator) Develop a Java application that determines the gross pay for each of
three employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee
and time and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40. You’re given a list of the employees, their
number of hours worked last week and their hourly rates. Your program should input this information
for each employee, then determine and display the employee’s gross pay. Use class Scanner to
input the data.

4.24 (Validating User Input) Modify the program in Fig. 4.12 to validate its inputs. For any input,
if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct value.

5.18 (Modified Compound-Interest Program) Modify the application in Fig. 5.6 to use only integers
to calculate the compound interest. [Hint: Treat all monetary amounts as integral numbers
of pennies. Then break the result into its dollars and cents portions by using the division and remainder operations, respectively. Insert a period between the dollars and the cents portions.]

5.30 (Modified AutoPolicy Class) Modify class AutoPolicy in Fig. 5.11 to validate the two-letter
state codes for the northeast states. The codes are: CT for Connecticut, MA for Massachusetts, ME
for Maine, NH for New Hampshire, NJ for New Jersey, NY for New York, PA for Pennsylvania
and VT for Vermont. In AutoPolicy method setState, use the logical OR (||) operator
(Section 5.9) to create a compound condition in an if…else statement that compares the method’s
argument with each two-letter code. If the code is incorrect, the else part of the if…else statement
should display an error message. In later chapters, you’ll learn how to use exception handling to indicate that a method received an invalid value.
